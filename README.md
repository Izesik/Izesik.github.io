# Isaacnunez.com
This is the first version of my personal website Isaacnunez.com built with React.js and Material UI and hosted on Github Pages

## Forking this repository
While I made this website for my own personal portfolio, please feel free to use the code to help build your own. It's not the greatest template but it gets the job done. 
All I ask is that you please provide proper credit where its due and link back to Isaacnunez.com. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **I did not build this site with the intention of it being a template so please refer to React and Material UI documentation for resources.**
